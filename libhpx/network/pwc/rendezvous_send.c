/// The rendezvous send functionality is implemented as a request-get-reply
/// operation. The initial request operation is sent as a small parcel that we
/// know will not use rendezvous. That request operation will run as an
/// interrupt, and allocate a buffer to recv the large parcel being sent. It
/// will then initiate a get-with-completion operation that copies the parcel to
/// the local buffer. Attached to that get-with-completion operation are two
/// events, the remote event will free the sent parcel, while the local event
/// will schedule the parcel once the get has completed.
