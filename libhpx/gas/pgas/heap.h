/// @file libhpx/gas/pgas_heap.h
/// @brief Implementation of the global address space with a PGAS model.
///
/// This implementation is similar to, and inspired by, the PGAS heap
/// implementation for UPC.
///
/// The PGAS heap implementation allocates one large region for the symmetric
/// heap, as requested by the application programmer. This region is dynamically
/// divided into cyclic and acyclic regions. Each locality manages its acyclic
/// region with a combination of jemalloc and a simple, locking-bitmap-based
/// jemalloc chunk allocator. The cyclic region is managed via an sbrk at the
/// root locality. The regions start out opposite each other in the space, and
/// grow towards each other.
///
///   +------------------------
///   | cyclic
///   |
///   | ...
///   |
///   |
///   | acyclic
///   +------------------------
///
/// We do not currently have any way to detect intersection of the cyclic and
/// acyclic regions, because the cyclic allocations are not broadcast. The root
/// has no way of knowing how much acyclic allocation each locality has
/// performed, which it would need to know to do the check.
///
/// @todo Implement a debugging mode where cyclic allocation is broadcast, so we
///       can detect intersections and report meaningful errors. Without this,
///       intersections lead to untraceable errors.
