Instructions:

Start with example2
1) Add a global addreses to the Domain structure and a global address to the
   InitArgs structure---both can be named complete.
2) In the main action, allocate an AND gate LCO called complete.
3) Pass the new LCO complete to initDomain and assign it to the Domain structure.
4) Add a new Domain action, called _advanceDomain_action, that just sets the
   Domain's stored 'complete' LCO, prints a message indicating that the domain
   terminated, and finishes.
5) Create an unsigned long called epoch, set it to zero.
6) After initializing the domains, use hpx_call and the 'epoch' variabel to
   start the first epoch for each domain.
7) Wait for the 'complete' LCO.
