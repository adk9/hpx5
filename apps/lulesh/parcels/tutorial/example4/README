Instructions:

Start with example3
1) Add int cycle to the Domain structure; initialize it to zero in initDomain
2) Increment the cycle by one in advanceDomain
3) If cycle is less than maxcycles, have advanceDomain call itself; when it reaches maxcycles, have it exit.
4) increment the epoch argument by one for each call to advanceDomain
