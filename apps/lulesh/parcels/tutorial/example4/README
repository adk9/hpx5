Instructions:

Start with example3
1) Add int cycle to the Domain structure; initialize it to zero in initDomain
2) In advanceDomain, set complete if we've performed maxcycle _advanceDomain
   iterations, print how many epochs we performed, and exit.
3) Update the domain's cycle to the current epoch.
4) If epoch is less than maxcycles, recursively hpx_call() _advanceDomain for
   the next opch.
