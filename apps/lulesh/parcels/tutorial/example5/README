Instructions:

Start with example4
1) Add two functions to perform an operation on a double, initialization to a
   large value, and min()
   - static void _initDouble(double *input)
   - static void _minDouble(double *output, const double *input)

2) Add a global address called newdt to the Domain structure and the InitArgs
   structure and update _initDomain_action to record it.
   
3) Create a new hpx_lco_allreduce_new; call it newdt; make it of size double and
   make it have nDoms inputs. Use the _initDouble and _minDouble functions for
   it's initalizer and commutative/associative op, respectively.

4) Send this allreduce to the domains in the initalizer.
   
5) In _advanceDomain_action, perform an allreduce every timestep.
