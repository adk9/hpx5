Instructions:

Start with example1
1) Add an action called _initDomain_action that initializes the Domain structure
   from an InitArgs buffer (use hpx_thread_current_target() and
   hpx_gas_try_pin() to get access to the Domain), and prints out a message
   saying the domain has been initialized.
2) Register the action as _initDomain in tutorial_init_actions().
3) Declare _initDomain as an hpx_action.

In main_action, after allocating the domain:
4) Declare an AND-gate LCO of size nDoms, called 'done'.
6) For each domain, compute the global address of the domain and send it the
   _initDomain message with a correct InitArgs structure, setting 'done' as the
   continuation address.
7) Wait for 'done'
8) Delete the 'done' LCO.
