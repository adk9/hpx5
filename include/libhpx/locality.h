/// @file include/libhpx/locality.h
/// @brief Exports all of the resources available at an HPX locality.
///
/// The locality is modeled as a structure containing the basic ingredients of
/// the LIBHPX runtime present in each PE. It is exposed within the library
/// through the global "here" object that gets initialized during hpx_init().
///
/// In addition to this object, a small set of actions is available for inter-PE
/// AM-based communication.
///
/// Furthermore, this file defines a number of inline convenience functions that
/// wrap common functionality that needs access to the global here object.
