/// @file include/libhpx/locality.h
/// @brief Exports all of the resources available at an HPX locality.
///
/// The locality is modeled as a structure containing the basic ingredients of
/// the LIBHPX runtime present in each PE. It is exposed within the library
/// through the global "here" object that gets initialized during hpx_init().
///
/// In addition to this object, a small set of actions is available for inter-PE
/// AM-based communication.
///
/// Furthermore, this file defines a number of inline convenience functions that
/// wrap common functionality that needs access to the global here object.

/// The locality object.
///
/// @field      rank The dense, 0-based rank of this locality.
/// @field     ranks The total number of ranks running the current job.
/// @field      boot The bootstrap object. This provides rank and ranks, as well
///                  as some basic, IP-based networking functionality.
/// @field       gas The global address space object. This provides global
///                  memory allocation and address space functionality.
/// @field transport The byte transport object. This provides a basic,
///                  high-speed byte transport interface.
/// @field   network The parcel transport layer. This provides an active message
///                  interface targeting global addresses.
/// @field     sched The lightweight thread scheduler. This provides the
///                  infrastructure required to create lightweight threads, and
///                  to deal with inter-thread data and control dependencies
///                  using LCOs.
