/// @brief The internal interface to the scheduler.
///
/// The HPX scheduler is a multithreaded application that provides lighweight
/// threads and local-control-objects (monitor/condition variables). It is
/// designed to work as part of a distributed set of schedulers to support a
/// large-scale, lightweight thread-based application.

/// The scheduler class.

/// The scheduler class represents the shared-memory state of the entire
/// scheduling process. It serves as a collection of native worker threads, and
/// a network port, and allows them to communicate with each other and the
/// network.
///
/// It is possible to have multiple scheduler instances active within the same
/// memory space---though it is unclear why we would need or want that at this
/// time---and it is theoretically possible to move workers between schedulers
/// by updating the worker's scheduler pointer and the scheduler's worker
/// table, though all of the functionality that is required to make this work is
/// not implemented.
