/// @brief Implement a simple parallel bitmap allocator to manage chunk
///        allocation for jemalloc.
///
/// We use jemalloc directly to manage our symmetric heaps. Unlike dlmalloc,
/// which provides a "memory space" abstraction, jemalloc operates in terms of
/// large "chunks," which are typically provided through the system mmap/munmap
/// functionality.
///
/// In our case, we want jemalloc to use chunks that we provide from our
/// global heap.
///
/// @note Our implementation is currently single-lock based. If this becomes a
///       synchronization bottleneck we can move to a non-blocking or more
///       fine-grained approach.
///
