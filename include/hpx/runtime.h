/// the context of this process. The @p entry action is invoked only on the root
/// locality. On termination, it deletes the main process and returns the status
/// returned by hpx_exit()
///
/// hpx_run finalizes action registration, starts up any scheduler and native
/// threads that need to run, and transfers all control into the HPX scheduler,
/// beginning execution of the top action in the scheduler queue.
///
/// The scheduler queue could be empty, in which case the entire scheduler
/// instance is running, waiting for a successful inter-locality steal operation
/// (if that is implemented) or a network parcel.
