Building and Running HPX
========================================== 

HPX will build and run successfully without any network backend, but
to be able to use HPX with multiple seperate processes, there are several
pre-requisites.

Requirements
------------
* MPI (optional)
* Photon (optional, requires MPI also)

At present, MPI is required for networking by HPX. However, Photon may
be used in addition to take advantage of RDMA over IB.

Configuration
-------------
The easiest way to configure HPX is as follows: 

* Download and build Photon 

* "./configure --with-mpi --with-photon"

Example Configuration on Cray Systems
---------------------
* Install check dependency

> module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu

Building
--------
* make

Running
-------

try running pingpong in hpx/examples:
"./pingpong 100"

hpx can benefit from allocators like jemalloc or tcmalloc, try preloading one:
"LD_PRELOAD=libjemalloc.so ./fibonacci"
"LD_PRELOAD=libtcmalloc.so ./fibonacci"

Running test directory
----------------------
To run the unit and performance test in tests directory:

"./configure --with-mpi --with-photon --with-check --enable-testsuite"
* make

Grab 2 nodes and 
* make check
